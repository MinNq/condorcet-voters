# Condorcet's voters

**Condorcet's jury theorem**, a work of French philosopher and mathematician Marquis de Condorcet, describes 
the behaviour of majority decisions corresponding to population sizes under certain assumptions. In this project,
I aim to understand more about the theorem by investigating a generalization of it. More details are described in [this post]
on my website.
